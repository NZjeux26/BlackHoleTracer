To adjust the intensity effects, here are the key numbers to experiment with:
1. Energy conservation power:
glslfloat intensity_factor = pow(max(0.1, total_shift), 2.0);

Current: 2.0 - Try 1.0 (linear) or 0.5 (square root) for less dampening
Try 3.0 or 4.0 for more dramatic energy conservation effects

2. Minimum clamp value:
glslfloat intensity_factor = pow(max(0.1, total_shift), 2.0);

Current: 0.1 - Try 0.3 or 0.5 to prevent extreme darkening
Try 0.05 to allow more dramatic dimming

3. Relativistic beaming power:
glslfloat beaming_factor = pow(orbital_doppler, 3.0);

Current: 3.0 - This is the theoretically correct value for synchrotron radiation
Try 2.0 for less dramatic beaming
Try 4.0 or 5.0 for more extreme brightness asymmetry

4. Overall visibility factor:
glslskybox_colour += shifted_color * photon_ring_factor * 0.8;

Current: 0.8 - Try 1.2 or 1.5 to make the ring brighter overall
Try 0.5 to make it more subtle
