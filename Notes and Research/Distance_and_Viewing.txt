 Recommendations to Decrease the Disk's Apparent Size
If your goal is to reduce how much of the screen the disk fills, try the following adjustments:

✅ Option 1: Zoom Out (Camera-Based)
c
Copy
Edit
.observer_distance = 150.0; // or 200.0
This pushes the camera back, making the disk appear smaller.

✅ Option 2: Shrink Disk Itself
c
Copy
Edit
.accretion_disk_outer_radius = 10.0;  // smaller disk
You can also increase inner_radius to make the dark region larger (simulate a more compact hot ring).

✅ Option 3: Wider Field of View
In your projection code:

c
Copy
Edit
double fov = 45.0 * M_PI / 180.0;
